- What is systems librarniship?
- a 45 year time period returns 131 results for 'systems librianship' - making it a very understudied area
- some say it should be IT experts who learn about libraries
- some say it should be librarians who learn IT
- either way the role requires continual learning as technology is always changing
- self-education is important and this course should help foster that
- cloud computing is becoming more popular

- Attention to detail is very important throughout the course and in this work - one slight spelling error results in a command or line of code not working at all

- Steps to setup Google Cloud virtual machine (VM)
  1. Use personal Google account and setup billing
-      https://cloud.google.com
  2. create project, name it and switch to the new dashboard
  3. install the gcloud CLI or connect to CLI via VM
  4. enable compute
  5. create an instance
  6. Micro-size, Ubuntu OS v. 22.04
  7. Will see VM listed once it is setup with internal and external IPs

Journal Entry 3: Module 2 - Project Management and CLI Intro - Week 2 Lecture: Learn the CLI
- 2 ways we interact with computers (GUI = graphical user interface and non-GUI = command line interface (CLU)
- CLI = greater control b/c text based
-   due to more specific commands
-   takes some getting used t
-   requires some memorization
-   can be automated
-   cons - attention to detail, small details missed can cause errors
  
-   Dr. Burns wrote 2 programs to help
  1. Flashcards
  2. Learn the CLI
     
- ls (lists files/directories)
- pwd (prints name of currrent directory)
- mkdir (creates new directory)
- rmdir (remoaves directory)
- cd (change directory)
- touch (creates empty file)
- echo (prints characters)
- cat (displays current file contents)

- File System
   - need to also learn how files are stored and the archetecture of the file system
   - modern OS tend to "hide" the file system like MAC OS
   - makes things easier at first, at the expense of truly learning the file system
   - Linux uses tree like architecture for the file system
   - paths = where in the tree a folder exists
